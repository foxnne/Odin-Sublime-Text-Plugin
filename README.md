# Odin-Sublime-Text-Plugin

Syntax highlighting, autocompletion, and Goto Symbol/Anything/Definition for the Odin language in Sublime Text 3. This is a pretty hacked together mess but it may provide a modicum of assistance for helping to learn Odin. The build command will only work if the `odin` executable is globally available. Note that Windows users will probably have to change the build command to call `odin.exe`.


## Installation
Download or clone this repo into your Sublime Text 3 Packages folder (found via Preferences -> Browse Packages).



## Acknowledgements
This whole plugin started out as a copy of [JaiTools](https://github.com/RobinWragg/JaiTools), since Jai and Odin are pretty simalar.
