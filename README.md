# Odin-Sublime-Text-Plugin

Syntax highlighting, autocompletion, and Goto Symbol/Anything/Definition for the Odin language in Sublime Text 3. This is a pretty hacked together mess but it may provide a modicum of assistance for helping to learn Odin. The build command will only work if the `odin` executable is globally available in your PATH. Also note that autocomplete will look for Odin's core and shared folders only in ~/Odin for now.


## Installation
Download or clone this repo into your Sublime Text 3 Packages folder (found via Preferences -> Browse Packages). It must be cloned into a folder named "Odin": `git clone https://github.com/prime31/Odin-Sublime-Text-Plugin.git Odin`



## Acknowledgements
This whole plugin started out as a copy of [JaiTools](https://github.com/RobinWragg/JaiTools), since Jai and Odin are fairly similar.
